Code is written in modern TypeScript/ESM with strict typing across packages. React components live under `web/src` using functional components, hooks, Zustand stores, and Tailwind utility classes for styling. Shared types/logic reside in `shared/src` and are imported via the `shared` workspace alias plus Vite path aliases like `@/`. ESLint (flat config) and TypeScript project references enforce consistency; no custom docstring requirements beyond TypeScript interfaces.
