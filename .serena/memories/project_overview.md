Type Fighter is a two-player typing battle game for event venues. The monorepo hosts a React + Vite + TypeScript frontend (Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Framer Motion, howler.js), Cloudflare Workers with Durable Objects for realtime gameplay, and shared TypeScript types/utilities consumed by both. Supabase (PostgreSQL) backs persistent data such as rankings, with docs outlining damage logic and architecture.
